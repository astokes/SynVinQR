SynVinQR
========

Kit winemaking bottle tracker with QR decals using MongoDB, pymongo, 
and the bottle framework. This began as a supplementary project 
alongside my 10gen coursework on MongoDB.  

The web application records brewing dates and methods, consumption 
dates, and tasting notes on a batch or bottle basis. 

Each bottle in storage has affixed a custom QR code (most 
conveniently to the top of the cork or cap) coding a URL uniquely 
identifying batch and bottle. 

Any smartphone with a camera, QR reader application, and web browser 
with connectivity to the coded URLs can be used to identify any bottle 
of wine by scanning the QR tag without phyically handling bottles 
to expose the generic and uninformative kit-vintage artwork.
