This directory mainly contains independent test programs which demonstrate a coding technique.  

The programs assume that mogod is running on port 27017 and that the database "etude" 
contains sample data objects.  

The script etude_restore can be used to populate the 'etude' database from 
the 'dump' directory

Most programs run a web server on interface 0.0.0.0 port 8800.
