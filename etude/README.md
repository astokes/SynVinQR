This directory mainly contains independent test programs which demonstrate a coding technique.  

The programs assume that mogod is running on port 27017 and that the database "etude" 
contains sample data objects.  

The script etude_restore or etude_import can be used to populate the 'etude' database from 
the 'dump' or 'data' directory.  See WARNING.md for compatibility information. 

Most programs run a web server on interface 0.0.0.0 port 8800.
