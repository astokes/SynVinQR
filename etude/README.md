This directory mainly contains independent test programs which demonstrate a coding technique.  

The programs assume the Mongo database "etude" contains sample data objects.  The script 
etude_restore can be used to populate the 'etude' database from the 'dump' directory

Most programs run a web server on interface 0.0.0.0 port 8800.
